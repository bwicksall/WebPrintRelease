Web Print Release

Web based print release for CUPS.

Author: bwicksall@owwl.org

Bits needed for Python
----------------------

Install the following:

   apt-get install python3-pip python3-cups git-core

As the user that will be running the app install required libraries:

   pip3 install flask
   pip3 install Flask-Caching
   pip3 install gunicorn
   pip3 install PyPDF2

Copy config.py.example to config.py

   cp config.py.example config.py

Run the app in development mode with the following command line:

   python3 app.py

Run the app with gunicorn for production:

   /home/printrelease/.local/bin/gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:4000 app:app

Configure WebPrintRelease to run as a service
---------------------------------------------

We will use Gunicorn as the web server for WebPrint Release.

As root create a new service file:

   vi /etc/systemd/system/WebPrintRelease.service

Paste the following into the file:

   [Unit]
   Description=Gunicorn instance to serve WebPrintRelease
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=printrelease
   Restart=on-failure
   WorkingDirectory=/home/printrelease/WebPrintRelease/
   ExecStart=/home/printrelease/.local/bin/gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

Reload services, enable and start WebPrintRelease:

   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable WebPrintRelease
   systemctl start WebPrintRelease

Note: If the main page is slower than expected delete /tmp/webprint and restart service.
The folder may have been created by a different user and ownership is wrong.

Configure CUPS
--------------

Cups needs some configuration to work as a print release system.  We will set up the default 
state of new jobs to "Held", change the default visibility of job names and modify default 
cups permissions to limit who can release jobs. We will also tweak PolicyKit to allow the 
print release user to release jobs.

First let's force new print jobs into a held state. This needs to be done for each printer 
on the server:

   lpadmin -p HP-LaserJet-400-M401 -o job-hold-until-default=indefinite

By default the print release user can't see job information for other users. To allow the 
display of job names and user names edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and edit the following:

<Policy default>
  JobPrivateAccess default
  JobPrivateValues none

Add the  print release user to the lpadmin group:

   usermod -G lpadmin -a printrelease

To allow the print release user (members of the lpadmin group) to release jobs they don't 
own create /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/allow-job-not-owned-edit.pkla with the 
following contents:

[Print job release not owned allow]
Identity=unix-group:lpadmin
Action=org.opensuse.cupspkhelper.mechanism.job-not-owned-edit
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=yes
ResultActive=yes

Now we need to edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and remove some rights from OWNER. To do that we 
create a new group under the default and authenticated policy and MOVE Release-Job 
Restart-Job Resume-Job Set-Job-Attributes to that group.  Notice only @SYSTEM has access 
to these actions. @SYSTEM refers to the lpadmin group:

Inside <Policy default>:

  <Limit Release-Job Restart-Job Resume-Job Set-Job-Attributes>
    Require user @SYSTEM
    Order deny,allow
  </Limit>

Inside <Policy authenticated>:

  <Limit Release-Job Restart-Job Resume-Job Set-Job-Attributes>
    AuthType Default
    Require user @SYSTEM
    Order deny,allow
  </Limit>

Note: Set-Job-Attributes is actually the key permission used here.

Page Counting
-------------

In the past we used pkpgcounter to count pages.  Unfortunately this application appears
largely abandoned and has not been fully upgraded to Python 3.  It is also not available 
in Debian 10+.  

To work around this I have pulled portions of code from pkpgcounter that I need to count
pages in the formats that are common in my environment.

   PDF, PCL, PostScript

A partially updated fork of pkpgcounter was used as a source:

   https://github.com/berghetti/pkpgcounter-1

Additionally the PyPDF2 library was used as an alternative for counting pages in PDF files.  
The code works but is currently unused.

Notes about using Locations
-------------------------

To automatically set the printer location use the following format:
