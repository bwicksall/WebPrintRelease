Some things to keep in mind when using this app.

1) This was written in Pyton 2 in an environment where it will only be used on Debian 9.  

Obiously I need to think about upgrading this to Python 3 in the future.  

2) pkpgcounter is used to count pages

This tool seems to be largely abandoned and it looks like it is being dropped from 
some distros.  That is too bad because this tool seems to do a really good job
of counting pages for all kinds of document.  

Alternatively we may use a tool like pdfinfo to count pages in PDFs.  This would limit 
our printing options a bit although it is not impossible.

What other tools are there for page counting?  What is the best rout?

Is pkpgcounter in Debian Buster?
